          <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>

          <map name="watchmap">
            <area
              shape="rect"

            If you're lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price
            tag. But I wasn't so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I'm here
            to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to
            you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: SET A BUDGET. If
            you're worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won't
            have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the
            designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and
            get excited!

          <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>
          <img

            alt="A man with a hat"

            Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don't you'll be
            uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is
            about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have
            chosen to epress through their new lines. Also it's important to
            wear shoes you'll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to
            look good, but you'll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.
